Students Portfolio Repo
​
You should have already had created a Student Portfolio Repo for both Frontend and Backend.
​
Start from the previous App.
Today we're gonna work on joining and pagination.
​
//BACKEND
​
Your previously developed backend should have the following routes included, if not, develop them:
​
GET students/:id/projects => returns a list of projects in which also the info from the students appears (use JOIN to retrieve those info)
- Add Sort, Skip, Limit to route GET /students/:
​
Client should have the possibility to call the route and set as query parameters sort, skip, limit. Skip and limit are numbers, sort is a string
containing the field to sort in descending order. [EXTRA] Try to send also the preference for ascending or descending order.
​
//FRONTEND
​
You should have the following features in your frontend:
​
- Show Students on a list (with pagination)
- Show Projects on a list (with pagination)
​
​
// EXTRA
​
Replace PG with Sequelize for all the queries ;-)
​
Create a new Table for LIKES and the API to add a Like to each project.
Every user can add a single like to a project.
